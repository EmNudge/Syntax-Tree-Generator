# Syntax Parser

This is a linguistics syntax parser, created in svelte and inspired by projects like [this one](https://github.com/int2str/jssyntaxtree) and [this one](https://github.com/mshang/syntree).

# How this differs?
At the moment of creation, the inspirations for this project did not include SVG output.
Additionally, it's generally easier for me to add functionality onto things if I created them. 

I'm hoping to get PWA support and a bunch of customization options.
Add issues for any ideas or enhancements you may have.
